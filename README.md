CIVIS10

CIVIS10 (Content Integrity and Validity Inspection System) is an automated tool for evaluating the credibility of online content. The algorithm performs an analysis based on five key criteria:

- Currency: How recent is the information?
- Integrity: The reliability and truthfulness of the content.
- Validity: The credibility and authority of the content or its source.
- Impact: How relevant is the content to the readerâ€™s needs?
- System: The integrated system that performs the evaluations across all these factors.

Features
- Currency Assessment: Identifies how recent the content is, and if it reflects current trends or knowledge.
- Relevance Detection: Dynamically extracts keywords from content and evaluates its relevance.
- Authority Check: Assesses the credibility of the author or the content source.
- Accuracy Check: Detects whether the content is fact-checked or can be verified.
- Purpose Detection: Determines the purpose of the content (informational, persuasive, or commercial).
- Sentiment & Bias Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and checks for any bias in the content.

Installation
To run CIVIS10 locally, you can use either `environment.yml` (for conda) or `requirements.txt` (for pip).
